10474002|There have been various methods proposed for diagnosing laryngeal pathology by analyzing the pathological voice.|
10474002|However, even if two diagnoses are the same, the voice quality might not be the same.|

10474009|The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of recent advances in voice research with special focus on clinical aspects and on the speaking voice.|
10474009|First an update on histological findings concerning the multilayer structure and the biomechanics of the vocal folds is given.|
10474009|Other topics are vocal fold closure patterns, the development of the voice from childhood to senescence, and theoretical aspects of vocal function from an acoustic-aerodynamic point of view.|

10474010|This paper discusses recent speech motor research into stuttering within the framework of a speech production model.|
10474010|There seems to be no support for the claim that stutterers differ from nonstutterers in assembling motor plans for speech.|
10474010|However, physiological data suggest that stutterers may at least have different ways of initiating and controlling speech movements.|
10474010|It is hypothesized that stuttering may be the result of a deficiency in speech motor skill.|
10474010|Furthermore, objections to the use of stuttering frequency as a severity index are formulated and future developments in the assessment of speech motor behavior in stuttering are described.|stuttering|sosy|39|48|COEXISTS_WITH|PREP|162|163|stuttering|sosy|165|174|

10474011|In modern societies about one third of the labor force are working in professions in which voice is the primary tool.|
10474011|Voice problems are common in general, but they are even more common in professions in which there is heavy vocal loading, i.e. professions that do not only require prolonged voice use, but also involve extra loading factors such as background noise, long speaking distance, poor room acoustics, lack of adequate equipment like voice amplifiers etc.|
10474011|School and kindergarten teachers can be considered to represent professions with heavy vocal loading.|
10474011|The occupational safety and health arrangements of voice and speech professionals are poorly developed as compared to many other professions.|
10474011|However, the existing legislation could be used to support efforts to improve the working conditions of this large but heterogeneous group.|

10474012|Like logopedics, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) has a short history and a long past.|
10474012|In the 1950s and 60s the field of AAC emerged as a response to the need of individuals who, despite years of 'traditional speech therapy', had not developed adequate oral communication skills, and for whom compensatory rather than remedial approaches were thus deemed advisable.|
10474012|Various trends like the shift from form to function in language development research, dissemination of sign language, use of non-speech graphic symbols, advances in computer technology, and international collaboration have all contributed to AAC's present-day status as a multidisciplinary enterprise involving speech-language therapists and an array of other professions.|
10474012|Clinical experience, for lack of comprehensive empirical studies, seems to indicate that AAC is warranted for congenital as well as acquired communication disorders.|

10494624|The natriuretic peptide (NP) system consists of three types of hormones [atrial NP (ANP), brain or B-type NP (BNP), and C-type NP (CNP)] and three types of receptors [NP receptor (R)-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C].|

10494624|NPR-A and NPR-B are membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases, whereas NPR-C is assumed to function as a clearance-type receptor.|
10494624|ANP, BNP, and CNP occur commonly in all tetrapods, but ventricular NP replaces BNP in teleost fish.|
10494624|In elasmobranchs, only CNP is found, even in the heart, suggesting that CNP is an ancestral form.|heart|bpoc|50|54|LOCATION_OF|PREP|43|44|CNP|nusq|24|26|
10494624|A new guanylyl cyclase-uncoupled receptor named NPR-D has been identified in the eel in addition to NPR-A, -B, and -C.|
10494624|The NP system plays pivotal roles in cardiovascular and body fluid homeostasis.|
10494624|ANP is secreted in response to an increase in blood volume and acts on various organs to decrease both water and Na+, resulting in restoration of blood volume.|organs|bpoc|80|85|LOCATION_OF|PREP|69|70|ANP|gngm|1|3|
10494624|In the eel, however, ANP is secreted in response to an increase in plasma osmolality and decreases Na+ specifically, thereby promoting seawater adaptation.|ANP|gngm|22|24|AUGMENTS|NOM|56|63|plasma osmolality|ortf|68|84|
10494624|Therefore, it seems that the family of NPs were originally Na(+)-extruding hormones in fishes;|extruding|orch|66|74|ISA|MOD/HEAD|66|83|hormones|horm|76|83|
10494624|however, they evolved to be volume-depleting hormones promoting the excretion of both Na+ and water in tetrapods in which both are always regulated in the same direction.|
10494624|Vertebrates expanded their habitats from fresh water to the sea or to land during evolution.|
10494624|The structure and function of osmoregulatory hormones have also undergone evolution during this ecological evolution.|

10494627|Fifty years ago it was reported that baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can form "petite colonie" mutants when treated with the DNA-targeting drug acriflavin.|
10494627|To mark the jubilee of studies on cytoplasmic inheritance, a review of the early work will be presented together with some observations on current developments.|

10494627|Recent investigation have revealed that rho 0-lethality can be suppressed by specific mutations in the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase of the petite-negative yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and by the nuclear ptp alleles in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.|mitochondrial F1-ATPase|aapp|143|165|PART_OF|PREP|167|168|Kluyveromyces lactis|fngs|196|215|Schizosaccharomyces pombe|aapp|251|275|PART_OF|PREP|248|249|ptp|fngs|236|238|mitochondrial F1-ATPase|fngs|143|165|LOCATION_OF|PREP|167|168|Kluyveromyces lactis|gngm|196|215|Schizosaccharomyces pombe|fngs|251|275|LOCATION_OF|PREP|248|249|ptp|gngm|236|238|

10494628|However, the problem of how cytoskeleton organization and its dynamics at the cellular level in turn affects main metabolic pathways of gene expression and cellular energetics is yet unsolved.|
10494628|The response given by cells to environmental challenges such as stress responses is crucially dependent on the organization of their architecture.|

10503188|An account is given of the early efforts to domesticate tetrahymenas as laboratory instruments for genetics.|
10503188|The rationale for developing a new organismic technology was the comparative leverage provided by a eukaryotic microorganism at a large evolutionary distance from both prokaryotic microbes and multicellular organisms.|eukaryotic|orgm|101|110|ISA|MOD/HEAD|101|124|microorganism|orgm|112|124|
10503188|The tetrahymenine ciliates were considered more favorable materials than paramecia because of their ability to grow on simple media, though in fact their simpler nutritional needs have never been fully exploited.|
10503188|The first task was to sort the large set of phenotypically similar but evolutionarily and molecularly diverse ciliates referred to at the time as T. pyriformis.|
10503188|Then a species amenable to genetic manipulation was identified and its culture and cytogenetics were brought under control.|
10503188|Fortunately, the very first breeding system investigated--that in the species now called T. thermophila--has proved to be suitable for a wide range of studies.|
10503188|A large factor in the program's success was its use of the foundation previously established by studies on paramecia.|
10503188|However, serious unforeseen difficulties were encountered on the way to "domestication."|
10503188|These included inbreeding deterioration associated with their outbreeding life-style and germinal deterioration (mutational erosion) in the unexpressed micronuclear genome after long maintenance in vegetative culture.|
10503188|Cryogenic preservation was an important means of escaping these organismic limitations, and somatic (macronuclear) assortment has proved a valuable supplement to meiotic recombination.|

10503207|Studying the telomerase RNA in Tetrahymena.|
10503208|As illustrated elsewhere in this volume, Tetrahymena is an extraordinary experimental system in which molecular genetics, biochemistry, and cytology can be applied to the study of a cell biological problem.|
10503208|Our long-term goal is to understand how the different structural domains of dynein contribute to its function.|
10503208|Our strategy is to create targeted modifications in an axonemal dynein heavy chain gene, recover the dynein protein from cilia, and evaluate the in vitro activity of the isolated dynein.|

10512545|Two kinds of omitted stimulus potentials (OSP) are called "fast" and 'slow."|
10512545|Fast OSPs, recently found with visual stimuli, are here extended to auditory;|
10512545|they occur after omissions or after the end of trains of 1 to > 20 Hz clicks.|
10512545|Slow OSPs, long known, follow trains of 0.3 to 4 Hz.|
10512545|Each has its constant peak latency after the due-time of the first missing stimulus, as though the system is expecting something quite accurately on schedule.|
10512545|They differ in dynamics and slow OSPs require the subject to attend;|
10512545|fast OSPs do not.|
10512545|Steady-state responses (SSR) at a critical click rate of 6-7 Hz sometimes appear to alternate between two forms and OSPs may depend on which they follow.|
10512545|Fast OSPs can occur to the first, second and even the third omissions after the end of a train.|
10512545|Short conditioning periods suffice.|
10512545|Irregular interstimulus intervals do not reduce fast OSPs but attenuate slow OSPs.|

10512546|Four groups of focal brain-damaged patients, involving left and right hemisphere damage with or without the involvement of parietal lobe, and a control group of general medical patients, were required (a) dichaptically to perceive two cognitive stimuli (letter letter, figure figure, or letter figure), and (b) haptically match the target stimulus from a set of test stimuli.|control group|grup|145|157|NEG_INTERACTS_WITH|NOM|109|119|medical patients|podg|170|185|

10512547|The present study examined sex differences in hemisphere preference (HP) assessed by the Preference Test (PT).|
10512547|This instrument is designed to measure the extent to which normal subjects rely on right-hemisphere or left-hemisphere cognition.|
10512547|Factor analysis on the total sample (N = 1,057; 473 men and 584 women) revealed a clear two-factor structure (i.e., left-HP and right-HP), although separate analyses for men and women suggest that this structure is more straightforward in men than in women.|
10512547|The main differences between men and women have to do with PT items relevant to language abilities, where women tend to be more symmetrically distributed across the two factors.|
10512547|However, the frequency of right- and left-HP is similar in men and women and does not change for men when PT scores are recalculated after removal of unspecific items.|
10512547|Furthermore, once the items that assess verbal abilities were excluded, the corrected PT value for women showed higher right-HP.|
10512547|Our results provide some indications of a less pronounced lateralization of hemisphere-linked cognitive abilities in women.|

10512548|The formant frequencies of a particular vowel vary according to the speaker group and to coarticulation.|
10512548|Therefore, overlapping formant patterns of different vowels are commonly related to sex and age differences and to coarticulation, and are considered to concern mainly the F1-F2 pattern of adjacent vowels.|
10512548|However, several studies have reported indications of a correlation between the lower formant frequencies and F0, as well as of the appearance of different formant numbers relevant to vowel identity.|
10512548|As a consequence, the overlap between formant patterns of different vowels might be more substantial than has traditionally been assumed.|
10512548|Within the present study, therefore, the extent to which a given formant pattern can represent different vowels was investigated for natural Swiss German vowels produced monotonously and in isolation by men, women and children at F0 of 85-870 Hz.|
10512548|Similar formant patterns were found for vocalizations of different vowels with both small and large phonetic distances, and within the entire frequency ranges of the formants relevant for phoneme identity.|
10512548|For vowel sounds displaying ambiguous formant patterns, the main spectral characteristics related to differences in their perceptual identity were found to concern F0 and relative formant amplitudes.|
10512548|Results are given in exemplary vowel series, and consequences for the psychophysics of the vowel are discussed.|

10512549|This paper explores subjective reports and physiological correlates of the experience of "consciousness itself"--self awareness isolated from the processes and objects of experience during Transcendental Meditation practice.|
10512549|Subjectively, this state is characterized by the absence of the very framework (time, space, and body sense) and content (qualities of inner and outer perception) that define waking experiences.|
10512549|Physiologically, this state is distinguished by the presence of apneustic breathing, autonomic orienting at the onset of breath changes, and increases in the frequency of peak EEG power.|
10512549|A model, called the junction point model, is presented that integrates pure consciousness with waking, dreaming, or sleeping.|

10545753|Genetic epidemiology faces six critical issues: its scope, genetic mapping, complex inheritance, population structure, nonmendelian genetics, and the internationalization of genetics.|
10545753|To solve these problems the scope must be broadened to include normal variation, although much of descriptive genetics will be lost to related sciences.|
10545753|Genetic mapping continues to play an essential role for positional cloning and chromosome architecture, which sequencing cannot replace.|
10545753|A large part of current effort is devoted to complex inheritance, requiring development of methods to pool multiple studies.|
10545753|The effect of population structure on forensic DNA identification appears to have been solved, but its effect for complex inheritance and genetic loads remains to be clarified.|
10545753|Populational analysis of non-Mendelian genetics has been largely neglected.|
10545753|The infrastructure of genetics must be internationalized if legal and ethical principles are to be supported and genetic epidemiology is to realise its potential.|
10545753|Unsolved problems in genetic epidemiology.|
10545754|It is argued that at the population level there are three central genetic developments raising ethical issues.|
10545754|The first is the emergence of 'soft' eugenics, due primarily to the increasing ability to detect carriers of genetic diseases, to monitor their pregnancies, and to provide the option to abort a fetus predisposed to major genetic disease.|genetic diseases|dsyn|110|125|PREDISPOSES|VERB|201|211|genetic disease|dsyn|222|236|
10545754|The second development is the recognition of the extent to which many serious diseases of adult life are due to a disturbance of ancient genetic homeostatic mechanisms due to changing life style, raising the question of whether a society that increasingly pays the medical bills should attempt to impose healthier standards of living on its members.|
10545754|Such an attempt at 'euphenics' may be thought of as the antithesis to eugenics.|
10545754|The third development relates to recognition of the need to regulate the size of the earth's population to numbers that can be indefinitely sustained;|
10545754|this regulation in a fashion (isogenic) that will preserve existing genetic diversity.|
10545754|Some ethical issues at the population level raised by 'soft' eugenics, euphenics, and isogenics.|
10545755|Eugenics, unlike science, involves decision making on various issues, and decision making involves the risk of making errors.|Eugenics|ocdi|1|8|ISA|SPEC|1|24|science|ocdi|18|24|

10545756|Appropriate combined models are discussed for the analysis of complex traits.|
10545756|It is argued that combined models may be necessary for optimally extracting the information from family studies.|
10545756|It is further argued that, especially as we face genes with much smaller effects, our ability to find these genes will depend on how precisely and accurately we are able to model the interrelationships.|
10545756|We need these newer models and methods for optimally extracting the information from family data, and we also need to reorient ourselves as to how we interpret the very information extracted.|
10545756|It is projected that path and segregation analysis, as seen in terms of combined models, will be useful in the new millennium.|

10545757|Genome-wide screening for localization of disease genes necessitates the efficient reconstruction of haplotypes of members of a pedigree from genotype data at multiple loci.|
10545757|We propose a genetic algorithmic approach to haplotyping and show that it works fast, efficiently and reliably.|
10545757|This algorithm uses certain principles of biological evolution to find optimal solutions to complex problems.|
10545757|The optimality criterion used in the present problem is the minimum number of recombinations over possible haplotype configurations of members of a pedigree.|
10545757|The proposed algorithm is much less demanding in terms of data and assumption requirements compared to the currently used likelihood-based methods of haplotype reconstruction.|
10545757|It also provides multiple optimal haplotype configurations of a pedigree, if such multiple optima exist.|
10545757|Haplotyping in pedigrees via a genetic algorithm.|
10545758|Population isolates are increasingly being used in attempts to map genes underlying complex diseases.|
10545758|To further explore the utility of isolates for this purpose, we explore linkage disequilibrium patterns in polymorphisms from two regions (VWF and NF1) in three isolated populations from Finland.|
10545758|At the NF1 locus, the Finnish populations have greater pairwise disequilibrium than populations from Africa, Asia, or northern Europe.|
10545758|However, populations from 'New Finland' and 'Old Finland' do not differ in their disequilibrium levels at either the NF1 or the VWF locus.|
10545758|In addition, disequilibrium patterns and haplotype diversity do not differ between a sample from the Aland Islands, Finland, and a collection of outbred Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families.|
10545758|These results show that linkage disequilibrium patterns sometimes differ among populations with different histories and founding dates, but some putative isolated populations may not significantly differ from larger admixed populations.|
10545758|We discuss factors that should be considered when using isolated populations in gene-mapping studies.|
10545758|Gene mapping in isolated populations: new roles for old friends?|
10545759|Genetic isolates with a history of a small founder population, long-lasting isolation and population bottlenecks represent exceptional resources in the identification of disease genes.|
10545759|Specific rare, monogenic diseases become enriched, and families with multiple affected individuals occur frequently enough to be used in linkage analyses for locus identification.|
10545759|Further, the vast majority of cases are caused by the same mutation, and disease alleles reveal linkage disequilibrium (LD) with markers over significant genetic intervals;|
10545759|this facilitates disease locus identification by similarity search for a shared genotype or haplotype in small study samples consisting of few affected individuals.|
10545759|LD observed in disease alleles adds power to linkage analyses and helps to define the exact location of disease loci on the genetic map.|
10545759|Typically, based on the linkage disequilibrium and the ancient haplotype, the critical DNA region can be defined from the original 1- to 2-cM resolution obtained in linkage analysis to 50-200 kb, greatly facilitating the targeting of physical cloning and sequencing efforts.|
10545759|These advantages have been well demonstrated in the positional cloning of several rare monogenic diseases enriched in population isolates like the example of Finland used here.|
10545759|How useful genetic isolates will prove to be in the identification of complex disease genes is dependent on the genealogical history of the isolate, including the size of the founding population and the expansion rate during the history of the population.|
10545759|Positional cloning of disease genes: advantages of genetic isolates.|
10545760|The present phase of the Human Genome Project is concerned with sequencing.|
10545760|The shift of emphasis has left an impression that mapping is in some sense complete or finished.|
10545760|On the contrary, faced with the challenges of mapping genes for complex traits and efforts to understand recombination and other biological processes, the need for accurate integrated metric maps is greater than ever.|
10545760|Furthermore, sequencing could be regarded as merely a way of improving the map, since the most useful 'end product' of the sequencing effort must be the annotated sequence that gives precise physical coordinates for markers and expressed sequences.|
10545760|Integration of both location and functional information, the latter provided by homology, expression and other functional studies, is the main target for the future.|
10545760|Mapping in the sequencing era.|
10545761|Most methods for localizing genes underlying complex traits work under the implicit or explicit assumption of a single disease gene with the possible exception of heterogeneity, that is, different disease genes in different families.|families|famg|225|232|LOCATION_OF|PREP|212|213|disease genes|gngm|198|210|

10546969|Problems in defining cross-cultural "kinds of homosexuality" --and a solution.|
10546969|Cross-cultural typologies of male homosexuality categorize widely different cultural expressions of same-sex behavior and orientation, but often without a deeper consideration of what it means for there to be kinds of homosexuality, or what the existence of separate kinds means for the category "homosexuality."|
10546969|In this paper the methods and results of these typologies are described and criticized, and a new interpretation of cultural expressions of homosexuality is offered in their place.|
10546969|The kinds of homosexuality are seen in terms of an activity of male consciousness, whereby male consciousness becomes progressively more oriented toward itself through each general kind.|
10546969|Finally a plan for a future systematic study of homosexuality is suggested, into which the reorganized typologies and other cultural material may be integrated.|
10546970|The discourse of the new sciences of homosexuality interacts with, reproduces, and sometimes challenges other discourses that inform and intersect it--popular discussions of scientific discoveries, legal discourse, debates about gay and lesbian identity, and religious discourse.|
10546970|Despite their different intentions and vocabularies, what links the discourse of the Christian right to that of contemporary sexology research and its popularized versions is its reproduction of a binary gender system, in which women are figured as both within and outside of "nature."|reproduction|orgf|180|191|PROCESS_OF|PREP|220|221|women|popg|229|233|
10546970|Researchers in gay, lesbian, and bisexual sexuality can make a significant contribution by exposing the ways their research contends with discursive practices that have a context and a history (in connections between Aquinas's theology and Aristotle's science, for example).|sexuality|inbe|43|51|PROCESS_OF|MOD/HEAD|34|51|bisexual|popg|34|41|
10546970|The narrative, rooted in traditional Christian theology and early Western science, that produces gender as binary and heterosexuality as normative can be rewritten to reveal the constructedness of both gender and sexuality.|

10546971|This study explored the possibility that changes in feelings of trust for mother are associated with gay males' decisions to disclose (or withhold) their sexual orientation in their mother-son relationships.|
10546971|Fifty gay and bisexual males completed a questionnaire about their coming out experiences in the context of their relationships with their mothers.|
10546971|As part of this questionnaire, they completed a retrospective graphical trust history task that involved plotting the degree of trust they felt for their mothers over time and across important events (such as disclosure).|
10546971|Results are discussed in terms of gay men's expectations about their mothers' responses to disclosure, the evidence for stability versus change in their memories regarding the nature of their feelings of maternal trust over time, the complexity of the trust histories participants drew, similarity between disclosers and non-disclosers in the shape of their trust curves, and the types of events and experiences that constituted the timeline or "plot" in the stories participants told about their mother-son relationships.|memories|fndg|154|161|PROCESS_OF|PREP|453|454|participants|popg|468|479|

10546974|Two anonymous questionnaires assessing attitudes toward gay issues were administered to adults living in the Shreveport/Bossier City, Louisiana area.|
10546974|In both, demographic data were obtained regarding gender, education, religion, age and marital status.|
10546974|In the second questionnaire, family groups were given the questionnaire.|
10546974|In the first survey, the results generally supported previous findings that religiosity, gender, and education at or below the high school level appeared to be associated with negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian issues.|
10546974|The variable most frequently associated with positive attitudes toward gay and lesbian issues was whether or not the individual had at least one gay friend, relative, or acquaintance.|
10546974|In the second study, the questionnaire was analyzed in terms of the entire group of subjects, family groups, and family positions.|
10546974|This second questionnaire indicated that similarities are most likely to exist among mothers and daughters, and same sex siblings.|
10546974|In regard to family members, wives/mothers and daughters had more positive attitudes toward homosexuality than sons, fathers, grandparents, other relatives, and in-laws.|

10547667|However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cell transformation and immortalization by E7 remain largely unknown.|
10547667|It is believed that E7 exerts its oncogenic function at least in part by modulating cellular growth regulatory pathways.|
10547667|Increasing experimental evidence suggests that cell transformation by E7 is mediated by the physical association of E7 with cellular regulatory proteins, whose functions are specifically altered by E7, as exemplified by the well-known interaction of E7 with the retinoblastoma protein.|
10547667|In this review, we summarize the available data on the interaction of E7 with cellular regulatory factors and functional consequences of these interactions.|
10547667|We will focus the review on a set of recently identified new target proteins for the E7 oncoprotein, which sheds new light on E7 functions required for cell transformation and immortalization.|
10547667|Similar to the case of the E6 protein of HPV-16, whose interaction with p53 was long considered its major activity, it now appears that the interaction of E7 with the retinoblastoma protein represents just one of many distinct interactions that are relevant for cell transformation.|p53|gngm|73|75|PART_OF|PREP|68|71|HPV-16|virs|42|47|

10547668|Cancer progression to the invasive and metastatic stage represents the most formidable barrier to successful treatment.|
10547668|To develop rational therapies, we must determine the molecular bases of these transitions.|
10547668|Cell motility is one of the defining characteristics of invasive tumors, enabling tumors to migrate into adjacent tissues or transmigrate limiting basement membranes and extracellular matrices.|
10547668|Invasive tumor cells have been demonstrated to present dysregulated cell motility in response to extracellular signals from growth factors and cytokines.|
10547668|Recent findings suggest that this growth factor receptor-mediated motility is one of the most common aberrations in tumor cells leading to invasiveness and represents a cellular behavior distinct from-adhesion-related haptokinetic and haptotactic migration.|
10547668|This review focuses on the emerging understanding of the biochemical and biophysical foundations of growth factor-induced cell motility and tumor cell invasiveness, and the implications for development of targeted agents, with particular emphasis on signaling from the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptors, as these have most often been associated with tumor invasion.|
10547668|The nascent models highlight the roles of various intracellular signaling pathways including phospholipase C-gamma (PLC gamma), phosphatidylinositol (PI)3'-kinase, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and actin cytoskeleton-related events.|
10547668|Development of novel agents against tumor invasion will require not only a detailed appreciation of the biochemical regulatory elements of motility but also a paradigm shift in our approach to and assessment of cancer therapy.|

10547837|The FASTA3 and FASTA2 packages provide a flexible set of sequence-comparison programs that are particularly valuable because of their accurate statistical estimates and high-quality alignments.|
10547837|Traditionally, sequence similarity searches have sought to ask one question: "Is my query sequence homologous to anything in the database?"|
10547837|Both FASTA and BLAST can provide reliable answers to this question with their statistical estimates;|
10547837|if the expectation value E is < 0.001-0.01 and you are not doing hundreds of searches a day, the answer is probably yes.|
10547837|In general, the most effective search strategies follow these rules: 1.|
10547837|Whenever possible, compare at the amino acid level, rather than the nucleotide level.|
10547837|Search first with protein sequences (blastp, fasta3, and ssearch3), then with translated DNA sequences (fastx, blastx), and only at the DNA level as a last resort (Table 5).|
10547837|2.|
10547837|Search the smallest database that is likely to contain the sequence of interest (but it must contain many unrelated sequences for accurate statistical estimates).|
10547837|3.|
10547837|Use sequence statistics, rather than percent identity or percent similarity, as your primary criterion for sequence homology.|
10547837|4.|
10547837|Check that the statistics are likely to be accurate by looking for the highest-scoring unrelated sequence, using prss3 to confirm the expectation, and searching with shuffled copies of the query sequence [randseq, searches with shuffled sequences should have E approx 1.0].|
10547837|5.|
10547837|Consider searches with different gap penalties and other scoring matrices.|
10547837|Searches with long query sequences against full-length sequence libraries will not change dramatically when BLOSUM62 is used instead of BLOSUM50 (20), or a gap penalty of -14/-2 is used in place of -12/-2.|
10547837|However, shallower or more stringent scoring matrices are more effective at uncovering relationships in partial sequences (3,18), and they can be used to sharpen dramatically the scope of the similarity search.|
10547837|However, as illustrated in the last section, the E value is only the first step in characterizing a sequence relationship.|
10547837|Once one has confidence that the sequences are homologous, one should look at the sequence alignments and percent identities, particularly when searching with lower quality sequences.|sequences|nusq|174|182|PART_OF|PREP|155|158|sequences|nusq|34|42|

10547837|Homology can be reliably inferred from statistically significant similarity.|
10547837|Whereas homology implies common three-dimensional structure, homology need not imply common function.|
10547837|Orthologous sequences usually have similar functions, but paralogous sequences often acquire very different functional roles.|
10547837|Motif databases, such as PROSITE (21), can provide evidence for the conservation of critical functional residues.|

10549354|In Drosophila, Wingless signaling mediates endoderm induction and the establishment of segment polarity in the developing embryo.|
10549354|The fly Wingless cascade is strikingly similar to the vertebrate Wnt signaling pathway, which controls a number of key developmental decisions such as dorsal-ventral patterning in Xenopus.|
10549354|Factors of the TCF/LEF HMG domain family (Tcfs) have recently been established as the downstream effectors of the Wingless/Wnt signal transduction pathways.|
10549354|Upon Wingless/Wnt signaling, a cascade is initiated that results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic beta-catenin (or its fly homolog, Armadillo).|
10549354|There is also a concomitant translocation of beta-catenin/Armadillo to the nucleus, where it interacts with a specific sequence motif at the N terminus of Tcfs to generate a transcriptionally active complex.|
10549354|This bipartite transcription factor is targeted to the upstream regulatory regions of Tcf target genes including Siamois and Nodal related gene-3 in Xenopus, engrailed and Ultrabithorax in Drosophila via the sequence-specific HMG box, and mediates their transcriptional activation by virtue of transactivation domains contributed by beta-catenin/Armadillo.|transcription factor|aapp|16|35|INTERACTS_WITH|VERB|40|47|regulatory regions|bacs|65|82|regulatory regions|aapp|65|82|INTERACTS_WITH|VERB|240|247|transcriptional activation|bacs|255|280|transcription factor|bacs|16|35|AFFECTS|VERB|40|47|regulatory regions|genf|65|82|regulatory regions|bacs|65|82|AFFECTS|VERB|240|247|transcriptional activation|genf|255|280|
10549354|In the absence of Wingless/Wnt signals, a key negative regulator of the pathway, GSK3 beta, is activated, which mediates the downregulation of cytoplasmic beta-catenin/Armadillo via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.|

10549354|Several other proteins, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), GSK3 beta, and Axin/Conductin, are instrumental in the regulation of beta-catenin/Armadillo.|

10549354|A proportion of APC wild-type colon carcinomas and melanomas also contains constitutive nuclear Tcf-4/beta-catenin complexes as a result of dominant mutations in the N terminus of beta-catenin that render it insensitive to downregulation by APC, GSK3 beta, and Axin/Conductin.|
10549354|This results in the unregulated expression of Tcf-4 target genes such as c-myc.|

10549355|Several biochemical attributes enable ErbB-2 to act as an epithelial cell amplifier of stroma-derived growth factor signals: It delays ligand dissociation, enhances coupling to the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and impedes the rate of receptor downregulation.|mitogen-activated protein kinase|enzy|182|213|DISRUPTS|VERB|228|234|receptor downregulation|ortf|248|270|

10549359|(2) the increased risk of CRC is not associated with an increased incidence of adenomatous polyps, which are necessary precancerous lesions in the development of common CRCs;|
10549359|(3) the tumor spectrum in Lynch syndrome is restricted to the colon and some extracolonic sites, whereas the responsible MMR genes are ubiquitously expressed;|

10552098|FORUM: Hypothesis-Driven Experimental Research Is Necessary for Natural Resource Management.|
10552099|/ Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from widespread agricultural/pastoral land use in New Zealand can result in receiving water quality problems, but the Resource Management Act of 1991 requires the sustainable management of land and water resources.|
10552099|Many similar types of problems occur in the United States, where the Clean Water Act is the primary legislation addressing NPS pollution and progress has been made on the development and use of a variety of management approaches.|
10552099|However, little evaluation and comparison of approaches or cooperation between the two countries has occurred in the past.|
10552099|This type of analysis could provide information that is useful for more effective management of the problem.|
10552099|The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare approaches used in New Zealand and the United States for management of agricultural NPS pollution.|
10552099|The role of the central government in New Zealand is generally limited to research and policy development, and regional councils are responsible for most monitoring and management of the problem.|
10552099|The role of the federal government in the United States includes research and monitoring, policy development, and regulation.|
10552099|States also have a significant management role.|
10552099|Both countries rely on voluntary approaches for NPS pollution management.|
10552099|Very few national water quality standards exist in New Zealand, whereas standards are widely used in the United States.|
10552099|Loading estimates and modeling are often used in the United States, but not in New Zealand.|
10552099|A wide range of best management practices (BMPs) are used in the United States, including buffer strips and constructed/engineered wetlands.|
10552099|Buffer strips and riparian management have been emphasized and used widely in New Zealand.|
10552099|Many approaches are common to both countries, but management of the problem has only been partly successful.|
10552099|The primary barriers are the inadequacy of the voluntary approach and the lack of scientific tools that are useful to decision-makers.|
10552099|More work needs to be performed on the evaluation of approaches developed in both countries that could be applied in the other countries.|
10552099|In addition, more cooperation and information/technology transfer between the two countries should be encouraged in the future.|

10552100|/ Past methods of prioritizing sites for protection and restoration have focused on lists of criteria or algorithms.|
10552100|These methods lack a common underlying framework, such that the process is explicit and repeatable, assumptions are highlighted, and commonalities and differences among prioritizations can be readily assessed.|
10552100|Our objective in this paper is to provide such a framework for cases where the goal of setting priorities is to maximize the ecological benefit gained from limited resources.|
10552100|We provide simple and general models that can be used to prioritize sites based on the projected ecological benefit per unit restoration or protection effort and to estimate the total projected benefit of restoring or protecting a set of sites.|
10552100|These models, which are based on an expression of the functional relationship between an end point and effort, hold up under a variety of situations and provide a common language for prioritization.|
10552100|We then discuss procedures for estimating model terms-calculations from regression curves when data are available, and use of judgement indicators when data are relatively limited.|
10552100|Finally, we present two case studies that apply the models and examine selected past prioritizations in the context of our framework.|

10552101|/ The potential for reestablishing dune habitat is investigated in municipalities in New Jersey, USA, where natural coastal landforms and biota have been eliminated or reduced in extent.|
10552101|Dunes are classified using width, relationship to natural and cultural features, and changes through time, and they are assessed for their value as naturally functioning landforms in developed municipalities.|
10552101|The relationship between size and longevity that exists under natural conditions is altered by human activity.|
10552101|Small dunes on privately owned lots can survive as long as larger dunes in natural areas that are located farther inland, and foredunes repaired using sand fences and earth-moving equipment can survive where they could not under natural conditions.|
10552101|Common beach management practices reduce the ecological values of coastal dunes.|
10552101|Mechanical beach cleaning eliminates incipient dunes, habitat for nesting birds, seed sources for pioneer dune colonizers and food for fauna, and artificially small, stabilized foredunes reduce the variability in microenvironments necessary for biodiversity.|
10552101|Recent initiatives for reducing coastal hazards, protecting nesting birds, and encouraging nature-based tourism provide incentive for the development of a restoration program for beaches and dunes that is compatible with human use.|
10552101|Suggested changes in management practice include restricting or rerouting pedestrian traffic, altering beach-cleaning procedures, using symbolic fences to allow for aeolian transport while preventing trampling of dunes, and eliminating or severely restricting exotic species.|
10552101|Landforms will be more natural in function and appearance but will be more dynamic, smaller and in a different position from those in natural areas.|
10552101|Research needs are specified for ecological, geomorphological, and attitudinal studies to support and inform restoration planning.|

10552102|/ The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a conceptual framework of environmental stress-response for a geomorphic system.|
10552102|Constructs and methods generated from the literature were applied in the development of an integrative stress-response framework using existing environmental assessment techniques: interaction matrices and a systems diagram.|
10552102|Emphasis is on the interaction between environmental stress and the geomorphic environment of a sandy barrier system.|
10552102|The model illustrates a number of stress concepts pertinent to modeling environmental stress-response, including those related to stress-dependency, frequency-recovery relationships, environmental heterogeneity, spatial hierarchies and linkages, and temporal change.|
10552102|Sandy barrier stress-response and recovery are greatly impacted by fluctuating water levels, stress intensity and frequency, as well as environmental gradients such as differences in sediment storage and supply.|water|inch|80|84|AFFECTS|VERB|56|63|recovery|orgf|35|42|water|inch|80|84|AFFECTS|VERB|56|63|stress-response|orgf|15|29|water|inch|80|84|AFFECTS|VERB|56|63|recovery|phsf|35|42|water|inch|80|84|AFFECTS|VERB|56|63|stress-response|phsf|15|29|
10552102|Aspects of these stress-response variables are articulated in terms of three main challenges to management: dynamic stability, spatial integrity, and temporal variability.|
10552102|These in turn form the framework for evaluative principles that may be applied to assess how policies and management practices reflect key biophysical processes and human stresses identified by the model.|stresses|fndg|172|179|PROCESS_OF|MOD/HEAD|166|179|human|humn|166|170|

10552103|/ This paper assesses the extent to which key geomorphic components, processes, and stresses have been reflected in the management of a coastal sandy barrier environment.|
10552103|The management policies and practices of selected agencies responsible for Long Point, a World Biosphere Reserve along Lake Erie, Canada, were evaluated for consistency with these principles of environmental management for sandy barriers: maintaining natural stresses essential to sandy barrier development and maintenance;protecting sediment sources, transfers, and storage;|
10552103|recognizing spatial variability and cyclicity of natural stresses, such as barrier overwash events;|
10552103|and accepting and planning for long-term evolutionary changes in the sandy barrier environment.|
10552103|Generally, management policies and practices have not respected the dynamic and sensitive environment of Long Point because of limited mandates of the agencies involved, inconsistent policies, and failure to apply or enforce existing policies.|
10552103|This is particularly evident with local municipalities and less so for the Canadian Wildlife Service, the federal agency responsible for managing National Wildlife Areas at the point.|
10552103|In the developed areas of Long Point, landward sediment transfers and sediment storage in dunes have been impacted by cottage development, shore protection, and maintenance of roads and parking lots.|
10552103|Additionally, agencies responsible for managing Long Point have no jurisdiction over sediment sources as far as 95 km away.|
10552103|Evolutionary change of sandy barriers poses the greatest challenge to environmental managers.|

10552104|/ Using a series of aerial photographs taken between 1936 and 1996, we trace coevolution of floodplain and riparian forest on the Willamette River.|
10552104|Within-channel barforms appear to be the predominant incipient floodplain landform and habitat for primary succession.|
10552104|Interlinked development of bar(s) and erosion of near banks, filling of channels, and establishment and growth of cottonwoods and willows results in coalescence with older floodplain.|
10552104|Sizeand internal structure of riparian forest patches reflect evolution of underlying barforms or channel beds.|
10552104|Floodplain matures as the active channel migrates away by repetition of the bar formation and near-bank erosion process, or is progressively abandoned by infilling and/or constriction with a bar.|
10552104|Other parts of the floodplain are recycled as eroding banks provide the coarse sediment and large woody debris for building new bars.|
10552104|A multichannel planform is maintained as building bars split flow;|
10552104|channels lengthen as bars and islands join into larger assemblages.|
10552104|Avulsion appears to cut new channels only short distances.|
10552104|Given the central role of bars and islands in building new floodplain habitat, we identify their area as a geomorphic indicator of river-floodplain integrity.|
10552104|We measure an 80% decline in bar and island area between 1910 and 1988 within a 22-km section.|
10552104|Dams, riprap, logging, and gravel mining may all be contributing to diminished bar formation rates.|
10552104|Removing obstacles to natural riparian forest creation mechanisms is necessary to regenerate the river-floodplain system and realize its productive potential.|

10552105|Regarding the organizational structure of the hospital, the first steps towards an integrating environmental management system as demanded by EMAS could be taken.|
10552105|Beside supporting advantages, e.g., improvement of environmental safety, public image and staff contentment, and potential economic benefits such as less cost to be paid for energy and water consumption, there are important restrictions of environmental auditing in hospitals.|environmental safety|hlca|52|71|TREATS|PREP|171|173|energy|fndg|175|180|

10552260|This study is an investigation of the relationship between muscle morphology and surface electromyographic (EMG) parameters [mean frequency of the power spectrum (MNF), signal amplitude (root mean square, RMS) and the signal amplitude ratio (SAR; i.e. the ratio between the RMS level during the passive part of the contraction cycle and the RMS level during the active part of the contraction cycle)] during 100 maximal dynamic knee extensions at 90 degrees.|
10552260|s(-1).|
10552260|Each contraction cycle comprised of 1 s of active knee extension and 1 s of passive knee flexion.|
10552260|The surface EMG was recorded from the vastus lateralis muscle.|
10552260|Twenty clinically healthy subjects participated in the study, and muscle biopsy samples of the vastus lateralis were obtained from 19 of those subjects.|
10552260|The relationships between muscle morphology and EMG were investigated at three stages of the test: initially, during the fatigue phase (initial 40 contractions), and at the endurance level (the final 50 contractions).|
10552260|Major findings on correlations are that SAR and MNF tended to correlate positively with the proportion of type 1 fibres, and RMS correlated positively with the proportion of type 2 muscle fibres.|
10552260|The muscle fibre areas showed little correlation with the EMG variables under investigation.|
10552260|The results of the present study showed that the three EMG variables of a dynamic endurance test that were investigated (RMS, MNF and SAR) were clearly correlated with the proportions of the different fibre types, but only to a small extent with fibre areas.|small|qnco|229|233|ISA|MOD/HEAD|229|240|extent|spco|235|240|

10552261|Whole-body cooling prior to activity has the potential to reduce thermal strain and fatigue during subsequent endurance exercise.|

10552261|Thus, the effect of pre-cooling on thermoregulatory responses was examined during an intermittent test under "normal" environmental conditions.|
10552261|Six male university soccer players [mean (SD) age 27 (2) years;|

10552261|The run was completed with and without pre-cooling under normal laboratory conditions (20 degrees C) and without pre-cooling in a heated laboratory (26 degrees C).|
10552261|The pre-cooling strategy involved exposure to a cold shower (26 degrees C) for 60 min.|
10552261|The pre-cooling manipulation lowered rectal temperature prior to exercise [-0.6 (0.6) degrees C, range -1.5 degrees C;|
10552261|P < 0.05].|
10552261|The rectal temperature response to exercise was significantly lower following pre-cooling than in the heated condition [pre-cooled 38.1 (0.6) degrees C, heated 38.6 (0.3) degrees C].|
10552261|The increase in rectal temperature during the second half of the protocol following pre-cooling was significantly greater than the increase observed under normal or heated conditions (P < 0.05).|
10552261|No significant differences were observed between the three conditions for oxygen consumption, heart rate, minute ventilation, rating of perceived exertion and plasma lactate, glucose or free fatty acid concentrations.|

10552263|In addition, the multiple correlation coefficient for six factors in predicting PWC150 was 0.726.|

10552265|The sample was divided into three age groups, 9-12 years, 13-15 years, and 16-18 years.|
10552265|Indicators of physical activity included estimated daily energy expenditure (EE) and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (median metabolic equivalents of energy expenditure above resting metabolic rate >/=4.8).|
10552265|Submaximal physical working capacity (PWC(150)) was determined using a submaximal exercise test on a Monark cycle ergometer.|
10552265|Echocardiographically determined dimensions included posterior wall thickness, septal wall thickness, and left ventricular mass (LVM).|
10552265|The analyses were based on partial correlation and analysis of covariance, controlling for age and body surface area.|
10552265|Relationships between EE/physical activity variables and cardiac dimensions were low and, at best, moderate (r < 0.45).|
10552265|With subjects grouped into tertiles by indicators of physical activity, LVM was significantly different only among 16- to 18-year-old girls (157 g vs 134 g in the highest and lowest quartiles, respectively; P < 0.05).|

10552266|The presence of Tc-99m neutrophils was greater in the exercised leg than the non-exercised leg at 2 and 4 h post-exercise (P </= 0.013) and greater in the exercised leg of the women compared to the men at 2 h (P = 0.03).|leg|blor|166|168|LOCATION_OF|PREP|149|150|leg|blor|92|94|

10552268|Antipyrine was administered orally and pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained from saliva and urine samples.|
10552268|After 3 months of participation in the exercise program, salivary antipyrine clearance was significantly increased by 17% mean (SEM) 0.42 (0.02) vs 0.36 (0.02) ml/min/kg;|

10552269|These experiments tested the hypothesis that short-term endurance exercise training would rapidly improve (within 5 days) the diaphragm oxidative/antioxidant capacity and protect the diaphragm against contraction-induced oxidative stress.|
10552269|To test this postulate, male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks old) ran on a motorized treadmill for 5 consecutive days (40-60 min x day(-1)) at approximately 65% maximal oxygen uptake.|
10552269|Costal diaphragm strips were excised from both sedentary control (CON, n=14) and trained (TR, n=13) animals 24 h after the last exercise session, for measurement of in vitro contraction properties and selected biochemical parameters of oxidative/antioxidant capacity.|
10552269|Training did not alter diaphragm force-frequency characteristics over a full range of submaximal and maximal stimulation frequencies (P > 0.05).|
10552269|In contrast, training improved diaphragm resistance to fatigue as contraction forces were better-maintained by the diaphragms of the TR animals during a submaximal 60-min fatigue protocol (P < 0.05).|
10552269|Following the fatigue protocol, diaphragm strips from the TR animals contained 30% lower concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides compared to CON (P < 0.05).|lipid hydroperoxides|lipd|108|127|PART_OF|VERB|70|78|animals|anim|62|68|

10552273|Nine elderly male subjects [mean (SD) age: 68.1 (4.8) years] and nine young male subjects [mean (SD) age: 23.4 (1.3) years] performed an incremental exercise test on a bicycle ergometer.|
10552273|After a warm-up at 30 W, the power was increased by 30 W every 1.5 min until exhaustion.|
10552273|Our results showed that at maximal exercise, power output, breathing pattern, and respiratory exchange values, with the exception of tidal volume and the "effective impedance" of the respiratory system, were significantly higher in the young subjects.|
10552273|The power output and oxygen consumption values at the anaerobic threshold were also significantly higher in the young men.|

10552273|In conclusion, the ventilatory response in elderly subjects is elevated in comparison with that in young subjects, both below and above the anaerobic threshold.|
10552273|This study demonstrates for the first time that this ventilatory increase, both below and above the threshold, is partly due to an increased lactate concentration.|

10552274|The aim of this study was to examine whether the increase in the energy cost of running (C(r)), previously reported to occur at the end of a prolonged run, could be influenced by the ingestion of either an artificially sweetened placebo (Pl) or a 5.5% carbohydrate (CHO) solution.|
10552274|Ten well-trained triathletes completed three testing sessions within a 3-week period.|
10552274|The aim of the first session was to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)(max)) and the velocity associated with ventilatory threshold (nu(VT)).|
10552274|The second and the third sessions were composed of two submaximal treadmill runs (20 min long, 0% grade, performed at nu(VT)), before and after an 80-min overground run, also conducted at nu(VT).|
10552274|During these submaximal tests, the subjects ingested (in a random order) either a Pl or CHO solution prior to the first submaximal run and every 20 min after that.|
10552274|During the first session, ventilatory threshold (VT) occurred at [mean (SD)] 81.2 (2.5)% VO(2)(max) and 16.5 (0.6) km.|

10552274|A significant effect of exercise duration was found on C(r) (DeltaC(r)) at the end of the run, whatever the solution ingested (DeltaC(r) = 5.7% and 7.01% for CHO and Pl, respectively).|
10552274|A reduction in the respiratory exchange ratio (from 0.98 to 0.90) was observed only at the end of the Pl trial.|trial|resa|106|110|USES|MOD/HEAD|103|110|Pl|medd|103|104|
10552274|In this study, C(r) seems to be affected only to a minor extent by substrate turnover.|
10552274|Moreover, the increase in the demand for oxygen, estimated from the increase in ventilation, accounted for only a minor proportion of the increase in C(r) (11% and 17% for CHO and Pl, respectively).|oxygen|elii|42|47|AUGMENTS|NOM|69|76|ventilation|phsf|81|91|
10552274|No correlation was found between the changes in C(r) and the changes in the other physiological parameters recorded.|
10552274|These results suggest, indirectly, that C(r) increases during a 2-h run at 80% VO(2)(max) in well-trained subjects can be explained mainly by alterations in neuromuscular performance, which lead to a decrease in muscle efficiency.|

10552276|The hypothesis that critical power (CP) is significantly lower than the maximal aerobic power of the knee extensors has been tested in nine endurance-trained subjects, seven gymnasts and seven weight lifters.|knee|blor|102|105|LOCATION_OF|MOD/HEAD|102|115|extensors|blor|107|115|

10552276|The hypothesis that CP corresponds to a steady state in metabolic and physiological parameters was tested in the gymnasts and the weight lifters by comparing CP with the fatigue thresholds of the integrated electromyogram (iEMG(FT)), lactate level (La(FT)), oxygen uptake (VO(2FT)) and heart rate (HR(FT)).|parameters|fndg|85|94|PROCESS_OF|PREP|107|108|gymnasts|prog|114|121|parameters|fndg|85|94|PROCESS_OF|PREP|107|108|weight lifters|prog|131|144|parameters|fndg|85|94|PROCESS_OF|PREP|107|108|gymnasts|prog|114|121|parameters|fndg|85|94|PROCESS_OF|PREP|107|108|weight lifters|prog|131|144|
10552276|The results of the present study demonstrate that the value of CP of a local exercise cannot be considered as the equivalent of the maximal aerobic power for general exercises.|
10552276|The values of P(4 min), P(6 min), P(8 min), P(10 min) and P(peak) were significantly higher than CP, and corresponded to 138, 126, 119, 115 and 151% CP, respectively.|
10552276|The results of the present study indicate that CP can be considered as an index of muscular endurance.|
10552276|Indeed, La(FT), iEMG (FT), VO(2FT) and HR(FT) were not significantly different from CP.|
10552276|All of these fatigue thresholds were significantly correlated with CP (r > 0.92).|
10552276|Moreover, the highest coefficient of correlation (r=0.71; P < 0.01) between the percentage of maximal aerobic power in cycling that corresponds to a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol x l(-1) (OBLA%) and the different local aerobic indices was observed with CP.|

10552277|Surface ES was also applied to seven able-bodied controls (AB) at two time points 18 weeks apart.|
10552277|ES consisted of 2 bouts of 20, 1-s isometric contractions with 2 s and 2 min of rest between contractions and bouts, respectively.|
10552277|The time from 20-80% of peak torque (rise time) and the half relaxation time (1/2 RT) were determined for the first and for the last few contractions.|

10552277|Rise time did not change over repeat contractions, was not different between groups, and nor did it change over the 18-week period (range: 150-172 ms).|
10552277|1/2 RT showed several group differences.|

10552278|In this study we determined the influence of improving aerobic power (VO(2max)) on basal plasma levels of insulin and glucose of 11- to 14-year-old children, while accounting for body fat, gender, pubertal status, and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) levels.|
10552278|Blood samples were obtained from 349 children after an overnight fast and analyzed for plasma insulin and glucose.|
10552278|Height, mass, body mass index (BMI), and sum of skinfolds (Sigma triceps + subscapular sites) were measured.|
10552278|LTPA levels and pubertal status were estimated from questionnaires, and VO(2max) was predicted from a cycle ergometry test.|
10552278|Regardless of gender, insulin levels were significantly correlated (P = 0.0001) to BMI, skinfolds, pubertal stage, and predicted VO(2max), but were not related to LTPA levels.|

10552278|however, BMI and skinfolds were correlated for males (P < 0.006).|

10552278|The 60 children whose VO(2max) improved (>/=3 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) had a greater reduction in circulating insulin than the 204 children whose VO(2max) did not increase -16 (41) vs -1 (63) pmol x l(-1);|

10552279|In this investigation we evaluated the effect of a 5-week training program at 1860 m on serum creatine kinase (CK) activity and serum cortisol concentration in national-caliber triathletes for the purpose of monitoring the response to training in a hypobaric hypoxic environment.|
10552279|Subjects included 16 junior-level female (n = 8) and male (n = 8) triathletes who were training for the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championships.|
10552279|After an initial acclimatization period, training intensity and/or volume were increased progressively during the 5-week altitude training camp.|
10552279|Resting venous blood samples were drawn at 0700 hours following a 12-h overnight fast and were analyzed for serum CK activity and serum cortisol concentration.|
10552279|Subjects were evaluated before [7-10 days pre-altitude (SL 1)] and after [7-10 days post-altitude (SL 2)] the 5-week training camp at 1860 m.|
10552279|At altitude, subjects were evaluated within 24-36 h after arrival (ALT 1), 7 days after arrival (ALT 2), 18 days after arrival (ALT 3), and 24-36 h prior to leaving the altitude training camp (ALT 4).|
10552279|A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate differences over time from SL 1 to SL 2.|
10552279|Compared to SL 1, serum CK activity increased approximately threefold (P < 0.05) within the initial 24-36 h at altitude (ALT 1), and increased by an additional 70% (P < 0.05) after the 1st week of altitude training (ALT 2).|
10552279|Serum CK activity remained significantly elevated over the duration of the experimental period compared to pre-altitude baseline levels.|
10552279|Serum cortisol concentration was increased (P < 0.05) at the end of the 5-week altitude training period (ALT 4) relative to SL 1, ALT 1 and ALT 3.|
10552279|These data suggest that: (1) the initial increase in serum CK activity observed in the first 24-36 h at altitude was due primarily to acute altitude exposure and was independent of increased training intensity and/or training volume, (2) the subsequent increases in serum CK activity observed over the duration of the 5-week altitude camp were probably due to the combined effects of altitude exposure and increased training load, and (3) the increase in serum cortisol concentration observed at the end of the altitude training camp reflects the additive effect of 5 weeks of altitude exposure in combination with a progressively increased training intensity and/or volume.|

10552282|We investigated body-fluid distribution in resting humans, during short-term, whole-body skin temperature modification, in which core temperature changes (DeltaT(c)) were minimal.|

10552282|Total body water (TBW), extracellular fluid (ECF), erythrocyte (RCV) and plasma volumes (PV) were measured using a simultaneous radionuclide dilution technique.|
10552282|In the cold, PV contracted by 205 ml (+/-60) by the end of exposure (p = 0.04), while in the heat, PV expanded 108 ml (+/-123; p = 0.02).|

10552282|Despite fluid movement across the vascular wall, ECF, interstitial and intracellular volumes were relatively unaffected by skin temperature.|

10553276|Aqueous phase separation is a general phenomenon which occurs when structurally distinct water-soluble macromolecules are dissolved, above certain concentrations, in water.|
10553276|The number of aqueous phases obtained depends on the number of such distinct macromolecular species used.|
10553276|Aqueous two-phase systems, primarily those containing poly(ethylene glycol) and dextran, have been widely used for the separation of biomaterials (macromolecules, membranes, organelles, cells) by partitioning.|dextran|phsu|81|87|TREATS|PREP|112|114|separation|patf|120|129|
10553276|The polymer and salt compositions and concentrations chosen greatly affect the physical properties of the phases.|
10553276|These, in turn, interact with the physical properties of biomaterials included in the phases and affect their partitioning.|
10553276|Specific extractions of biomaterials can be effected by including affinity ligands in the systems.|
10553276|The phase systems can also be used to obtain information on the surface properties of materials partitioned in them;|
10553276|to study interactions between biomaterials;|
10553276|and to concentrate such materials.|
10553276|Partitioning and concentrating biomaterials in aqueous phase systems.|
10553277|Affinity partitioning is a special branch of biomaterials separations using aqueous two-phase systems.|
10553277|It combines the capability of diverse biomolecules to partition in aqueous two-phase systems using the principle of biorecognition.|
10553277|As a result, the macromolecule exhibiting affinity for a certain ligand is transferred to that phase where the ligand is present.|
10553277|This chapter describes the present status of the theoretical background of this approach and the properties of various natural and artificial compounds which act as affinity ligands in liquid-liquid systems.|

10553278|Incompatible pairs of polymers separate into two phases in aqueous solution above a few percentage points total concentration.|
10553278|Protein pairs can also produce phase separation, but at somewhat higher concentrations.|
10553278|In this chapter, we explore the effect of high background concentrations of macromolecules on phase separation of pairs of species which would not be at sufficiently high concentration to separate in the absence of the uninvolved species.|macromolecules|chvs|77|90|AFFECTS|NOM|33|38|separation|patf|101|110|
10553278|Effects produced by such high background concentrations are known as macromolecular crowding.|
10553278|Dramatic enhancements in various association reactions due to crowding have been predicted and observed but its effects on phase separation in biological mixtures typical of the cytoplasm have not been examined.|
10553278|Here, we describe a calculation based on the Flory-Huggins treatment of concentrated polymer solutions that sheds some light on this issue.|
10553278|We find that a background of 20 wt % of a high molecular weight species greatly reduces the concentrations needed to produce phase separation in a mixture of two incompatible macromolecules if one is more hydrophobic than the other.|
10553278|Given the high total concentration of macromolecules in cytoplasm, it is perhaps surprising that phases have not been observed.|

10553279|Cytoplasmic transparency is a unique feature of lens cells.|
10553279|The cytoplasm is a concentrated solution of crystallin proteins with minor constituents that include cytoskeletal proteins and lens specific intermediate filaments.|
10553279|Under normal physiological conditions, the proteins exist as a single transparent phase.|
10553279|With normal aging, progressive modification of the interactions between lens proteins occurs so that conditions within the lens become favorable for phase separation.|lens|bpoc|124|127|LOCATION_OF|PREP|113|118|lens proteins|aapp|73|85|favorable|bpoc|136|144|LOCATION_OF|PREP|146|148|separation|aapp|156|165|lens|phsu|124|127|TREATS|PREP|113|118|lens proteins|patf|73|85|favorable|phsu|136|144|TREATS|PREP|146|148|separation|patf|156|165|
10553279|These conditions produce intracellular inhomogeneities that approach or exceed the dimensions of the wavelength of visible light (400 to 700 nm) and light scattering from lens cells increases.|

10553280|Classical biochemistry is founded on several assumptions valid in dilute aqueous solutions that are often extended without question to the interior milieu of intact cells.|
10553280|In the first section of this chapter, we present these assumptions and briefly examine the ways in which the cell interior may depart from the conditions of an ideal solution.|
10553280|In the second section, we summarize experimental evidence regarding the physical properties of the cell cytoplasm and their effect on the diffusion and binding of macromolecules and vesicles.|cytoplasm|celc|105|113|PART_OF|MOD/HEAD|100|113|cell|cell|100|103|macromolecules|celc|164|177|PART_OF|NOM|125|130|diffusion|cell|139|147|cytoplasm|chvs|105|113|AFFECTS|MOD/HEAD|100|113|cell|npop|100|103|macromolecules|chvs|164|177|AFFECTS|NOM|125|130|diffusion|npop|139|147|
10553280|While many details remain to be worked out, it is clear that the aqueous phase of the cytoplasm is crowded rather than dilute, and that the diffusion and partitioning of macromolecules and vesicles in cytoplasm is highly restricted by steric hindrance as well as by unexpected binding interactions.|cytoplasm|celc|202|210|LOCATION_OF|PREP|199|200|vesicles|acab|190|197|

10553282|One of the accepted characterizations of the living state is that it is complex to an extraordinary degree.|
10553282|Since our current understanding of the living condition is minimal and fragmentary, it is not surprising that our first descriptions are simplistic.|
10553282|However, in certain areas of metabolism, especially those that have been amenable to experimentation for the longest period of time, the simplistic explanations have been the most difficult to revise.|
10553282|For example, current texts of general biochemistry still view metabolism as occurring by a series of independent enzymes dispersed in a uniform aqueous environment.|
10553282|This notion has been shown to be deeply flawed by both experimental and theoretical considerations.|
10553282|Thus, there is ample evidence that, in many metabolic pathways, specific interactions between sequential enzymes occur as static and/or dynamic complexes.|

10556367|The compound classes of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and a number of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHs) in the River Elbe and its tributary Mulde were investigated on the basis of monthly mixed samples of suspended particulate matter (SPM).|
10556367|Covering the period from September 1994 to August 1995, samples from the River Elbe were taken at Hamburg, those from the River Mulde at Dessau.|
10556367|The samples were extracted by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).|
10556367|Analysis of all substance groups were performed by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC), followed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MSD).|
10556367|As a statistical approach for the interpretation of data, hierarchical cluster analysis of the individual compound classes were performed to determine differences or similarities between the sampling sites Hamburg and Dessau to find spatial and seasonal concentration patterns.|
10556367|These analysis showed that, with a high significance, the concentration patterns of n-alkanes, PAHs, and CHs were sampling site-specific in both the Elbe and Mulde throughout the entire sampling period.|

10556367|The particle-bound pollutant loads for the River Elbe at Hamburg were estimated to 13.4 t/a n-alkanes, 4.1 t/a PAHs, and 175.|

10556367|The pollutant loads for the River Mulde at Dessau amounted 0.55 t/a n-alkanes, 0.14 t/a PAHs, and 15.5 kg/a CHs during the monitoring period.|
10556367|The input of n-alkanes originated from different sources.|
10556367|The n-alkane pattern of samples of the River Elbe showed a predominance of odd-numbered compounds in the range of C-20 and C-30 originating from terrestrial plants and, depending on the season, high concentrations of C-15 and C-17 due to aquatic organisms.|
10556367|Only a small proportion of n-alkane input originated from petroleum sources.|
10556367|Samples from the River Mulde showed high amounts of the n-alkanes C-12 to C-15, indicating the input of light oil throughout the entire sampling period, constituting approximately 25% of the total n-alkane concentration.|
10556367|PAHs, which are considered combustion products, were widely distributed in all samples.|
10556367|Although the major inputs of PAHs were probably combustion sources and urban runoff, unusually high concentrations were found for some PAHs, which can be explained by point sources.|
10556367|A comparison of the standardized PAH patterns in samples from both stations clearly showed that higher fused ring systems, which mainly originate from combustion processes (four- to six-ring systems), had considerably higher relative concentrations in SPM from the Elbe than from the Mulde, where higher relative concentrations of the two- and three-ring systems were measured.|
10556367|This confirms findings that petroleum input was higher in the Mulde than in the Elbe.|

10557889|Data from a sample of 5530 Nebraska adults under age 65 are used to analyze the independent correlates of four different insurance statuses: insured 12 consecutive months, uninsured 12 consecutive months, insured at the end of a 12 month period, but not throughout, and uninsured at the end of a 12 month period, but not throughout.|
10557889|The effects of insurance status on utilization of health care services when perceived to be needed are assessed, controlling for demographic explanations.|
10557889|The results show that uninsurance status, whether long-lasting or recent, indicates lower utilization than being insured.|
10557889|Policies designed to expand the number of persons with insurance, especially those linked to practices of insurers, are predicted to have little impact since the underlying causes of uninsurance are related to household income.|
10557889|Lower use of health care services among the uninsured is thought to present financial problems to providers, since the uninsured who do seek care are more likely to need more services (without paying).|
10557889|Problems of higher cost to treat these individuals also present problems for public policies that in effect create subsidies to expand the number of insured.|
10557889|Finally, this study indicates that incremental policy approaches may not deal adequately with the fundamental problems that result in increases in the number of uninsured Americans and caring for their health care needs.|

10559744|In this study matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight mass spectrometry is developed and applied as a novel surface analytical method to enable analysis of adsorbed multicomponent biomolecule layers directly on the biomaterial surfaces.|
10559744|We show that proteins adsorbed in vivo (on human eyes) on contact lenses can be detected rapidly and conveniently by the diagnostic highly resolved mass signals recorded by MALDI mass spectrometry.|eyes|bpoc|50|53|PART_OF|MOD/HEAD|44|53|human|humn|44|48|

10559747|Protein adsorption onto the surface of an implanted material is widely recognized as an important factor controlling the biological response.|

10559747|As a basic science approach to investigate protein-surface interactions, an experimental method is developed and applied to determine apparent thermodynamic parameters for the adsorption of a single midchain peptidyl residue onto a glass surface.|

10559748|Thin layers of gold were deposited on polyurethane film and chemisorbed with three peptides having an N-terminal cysteine: Cys-Pro-Arg, Cys-(L)Phe-Pro-Arg, and Cys-(D)Phe-Pro-Arg.|
10559748|The ability of these surfaces to act as thrombin scavengers was evaluated.|
10559748|The peptides are related to the known thrombin inhibitor Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone and were shown to have significant thrombin inhibitory activity in solution.|

10559748|It was also found that the activity of thrombin adsorbed on the peptide surfaces was inhibited, and inhibition was greatest on the Cys-(D)Phe-Pro-Arg surface.|

10559749|Clinical studies indicate that soft tissue responses around dental implants vary, depending on the material used.|
10559749|It is therefore also possible that there are differences in how epithelial cells attach to various biomaterial surfaces.|
10559749|We studied the adhesion of cultured epithelial cells to five different dental material surfaces and to glass.|
10559749|The efficacy of adhesion was evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) with antibodies to vinculin and alpha(6)beta(4) integrin, two cell surface molecules that are functional in epithelial cell adhesion.|
10559749|Our results indicate that epithelial cells adhere and spread more avidly on metallic surfaces (titanium, Ti(6)Al(4)V titanium alloy, dental gold alloy) than on ceramic surfaces (dental porcelain, aluminum oxide).|
10559749|As revealed by SEM, cells on metallic surfaces had a flattened morphology and formed multicellular islands.|
10559749|On porcelain and aluminum oxide most cells were round and adhesion occurred as single cells.|
10559749|Surface coverage was over twofold on metallic surfaces as compared to ceramic surfaces.|

10559750|Sterilization is required for using any device in contact with the human body.|
10559750|Numerous authors have studied device properties after sterilization and reported on bulk and surface modifications of many materials after processing.|
10559750|These surface modifications may in turn influence device biocompatibility.|
10559750|Still, data are missing on the effect of sterilization procedures on new biomaterials such as nickel-titanium (NiTi).|
10559750|Herein we report on the effect of dry heat, steam autoclaving, ethylene oxide, peracetic acid, and plasma-based sterilization techniques on the surface properties of NiTi.|
10559750|After processing electropolished NiTi disks with these techniques, surface analyses were performed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and contact angle measurements.|
10559750|AES analyses revealed a higher Ni concentration (6-7 vs. 1%) and a slightly thicker oxide layer on the surface for heat and ethylene oxide processed materials.|
10559750|Studies of surface topography by AFM showed up to a threefold increase of the surface roughness when disks were dry heat sterilized.|
10559750|An increase of the surface energy of up to 100% was calculated for plasma treated surfaces.|
10559750|Our results point out that some surface modifications are induced by sterilization procedures.|

10559751|Interleukin 1 (IL-1) production levels on the PEUs, especially on PU-6, also decreased in comparison with the glass dish.|

10559751|In particular, the O(2)(-) release on PU-6, possessing the lowest tumorigenic potential in vivo, reached the highest level among the PEUs tested.|
10559751|To clarify the causes that enhanced O(2)(-) release from Mos, the methanol extracts of the three PEUs and chemicals that constitute the PEUs were tested.|
10559751|The extracts and 1,4-butanediol did not show an effect on O(2)(-) release.|
10559751|However, 4, 4'-di(ethoxycarboamide) diphenylmethane, a model hard segment of PEU, was remarkably enhanced, whereas poly(tetramethyleneoxide), a soft segment of PEU, reduced the O(2)(-) release in a dose-dependent manner.|
10559751|From these results, although it is still unclear what affects different types of O(2)(-) production, lower tumorigenic potentials of PU-6 may be caused by O(2)(-) release from Mos, which play an important role in the tumoricidal process.|
10559751|Further, the low IL-1 production on PU-6 suggests that PU-6 suppresses inflammatory responses other than O(2)(-) production in vivo, resulting in lower tumorigenic potentials.|IL-1|aapp|18|21|DISRUPTS|VERB|61|70|inflammatory responses|patf|72|93|

10564583|HLA class I and beta-2-microglobulin (beta2m) expression in a moderately differentiated laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma appeared to be downregulated when analyzed by immunohistochemical procedures using the monomorphic anti-HLA class I monoclonal antibody (mAb; W6/32), locus-specific (HCA2 and HC10) and allele-specific (LT129.11 and KRE501) mAbs and anti-beta2m mAbs.|
10564583|To reveal the molecular basis of downregulated HLA class I expression, HLA-A typing was performed on DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and the tumor.|

10564583|In addition to HLA-A*02011, 31012 alleles, the tumor contained an HLA-A*31012 allele, which lacked all introns when sequenced from the initiation codon through exon eight.|

10564587|Chromosomal aberrations are believed to result from the incorrect joining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).|
10564587|In an attempt to investigate induction and rejoining quality of DSBs following ionizing radiation exposure in specific genomic locations of mammalian DNA, an experimental approach based on Southern hybridization of single-copy probes to NotI restriction fragments was developed.|
10564587|Induction of DSBs is measured from the decrease of the band intensity representing the unbroken restriction fragment.|
10564587|An increase in intensity of the hybridization band following repair incubation determines reconstitution of the original restriction fragment and thus rejoining of correct DNA ends.|
10564587|We investigated the dose dependence of DSB misrejoining using X-ray doses of 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 Gy and provide evidence that the number of misrejoined DSBs exceeds, for the same doses used, the number of cytogenetically visible aberrations by an order of magnitude, reflecting the higher resolution of our assay.|

10564588|So far, the genetic features of this tumor have not been well characterized.|
10564588|Recently, a high incidence of BCL6 rearrangements has been detected in HGBL.|
10564588|However, no previous cytogenetic studies have found translocations involving the BCL6 locus (3q27) in HGBL, and the genetic basis underlying the BCL6 rearrangements in this tumor remains unclear.|BCL6|gngm|82|85|ASSOCIATED_WITH|VERB|68|76|translocations|comd|53|66|cytogenetic studies|gngm|22|40|ASSOCIATED_WITH|PREP|100|101|HGBL|comd|103|106|BCL6|lbpr|82|85|DIAGNOSES|VERB|68|76|translocations|neop|53|66|cytogenetic studies|lbpr|22|40|DIAGNOSES|PREP|100|101|HGBL|neop|103|106|

10564589|In breast cancer, allelotyping studies have indicated the existence of three to four distinct regions of allelic imbalance.|
10564589|Chromosome transfer studies have shown the presence of several growth inhibiting or senescence promoting genes in the segment between 6q13 and 6q27.|
10564589|Moreover, results from comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses have indicated that 6q was indeed a site of chromosomal losses, but that it was also involved in a substantial number of gains.|
10564589|In the present work, we allelotyped 178 pairs of breast tumor and normal tissue DNAs using 30 CA repeat markers from the Genethon collection.|
10564589|Seventy-six percent of the tumors in our panel displayed allelic imbalance (AI) of at least one locus, but patterns of AI could be complex.|
10564589|Whereas 11 tumors showed AI at all markers tested, 57 presented zebra profiles, and 28 showed AI at one site only.|
10564589|We characterized five distinct domains of AI defined, from centromere to telomere, by D6S300 (domain 1), D6S434 (domain 2), D6S261 (domain 3), D6S314-D6S409 (domain 4), and D6S441-D6S415 (domain 5).|
10564589|Some of the domains could be narrowed down to intervals of 1cM or less.|
10564589|We performed CGH analysis on a subset of 34 tumors presenting AI of variable extent at 6q.|
10564589|In 10/34 tumors, CGH did not reveal any anomaly on 6q.|
10564589|Most of these presented AI on short intervals, thus being below the detection threshold by CGH.|
10564589|Of the remaining 24 tumors presenting anomalies by CGH, 11 presented gains involving all or portions of 6q and 15 losses (2 presented combined losses and gains).|
10564589|By CGH, the 6q21-22 region was most commonly involved in gains, whereas 6q13-14 and 6q25-27 were frequently lost.|
10564589|Thus, allelic imbalances on 6q can either represent a gain or a loss depending on the region involved.|

10564590|Although a relatively large proportion of breakpoints is clustered, many are missed by standard PCR.|
10564590|A FISH assay is therefore desired.|
10564590|Up to now, a lack of probes flanking the BCL2 gene has limited the possibilities for a FISH assay to an approach based on colocalization of probes for BCL2 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus.|assay|lbpr|93|97|USES|PREP|82|84|probes|medd|22|27|

10564590|The assay was applied to a series of 40 follicular lymphomas.|
10564590|To evaluate the results, the same lymphomas were analyzed by DNA fiber FISH with a 600-kb set of BCL2 DNA clones labeled in alternating colors in combination with a color barcode covering the IGH locus.|lymphomas|neop|35|43|PROCESS_OF|PREP|122|123|colors|npop|137|142|
10564590|This approach allowed precise mapping of BCL2 breakpoints, and simultaneously showed juxtaposition of IGH genes to BCL2.|
10564590|Comparison of the results of interphase and fiber FISH showed complete correlation.|
10564590|Five cases were negative with both FISH techniques as well as with Southern blotting.|
10564590|Interestingly, all of these 5 cases lacked BCL2 overexpression as determined by immunohistochemistry, against 3 of 35 rearrangement-positive follicular lymphomas.|
10564590|Furthermore, absence of t(14;18) seemed to be correlated with a higher histologic grade (grades 2 and 3 according to Berard).|
10564590|These data indicate that the segregation-based interphase FISH assay detects 100% of BCL2 rearrangements.|
10564590|Because interpretation of the results is straightforward and requires no extensive experience, this assay may be the best available diagnostic test for BCL2 rearrangement.|

10564591|The target gene(s) for this gain is not known, although MYC is amplified in a subset of advanced tumors and is one potential candidate.|

10564715|The aggregation process of alpha-hANP has been investigated in vitro at physiological concentrations by gel chromatographic procedures using a radiolabeled tracer incubated in PBS and in plasma.|
10564715|In PBS big forms of ANP are organized as a peak eluting from both Sephacryl S-100 and S-300 HR in the void volume of the columns;|

10564715|After gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 HR the major peak appears to consist of three components of different molecular size.|

10564715|The comparison between the two time courses of big ANP formation indicates that: (a) ANP aggregation is a nucleation-dependent process, with a lag time longer than 8 days, at picogram peptide levels and (b) the aggregated forms of peptide are those eluting in the void volume, the other plasma peaks being probably expression of a binding, neither saturable or reversible, to some plasma components.|
10564715|The principle of seeded polymerization, used to detect ANP aggregates present in the plasma, indicates that: (a) the endogenous big ANP cannot act as a nucleus for polymerization and it likely consists of non-fibrillar ANP aggregates and/or bound ANP, and (b) this experimental approach can be suitable to evidence ANP binding plasma factors for further characterization studies.|

10564717|The present work investigates the effect of malondialdehyde (MDA) binding on the enzymic activity and on some structural properties of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).|glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase|aapp|136|168|INTERACTS_WITH|NOM|67|73|malondialdehyde|orch|45|59|
10564717|We studied whether alpha-crystallin could protect the enzyme against MDA damage, and if so, by what mechanism.|
10564717|We also studied whether alpha-crystallin could renature G6PD denatured by MDA.|
10564717|alpha-Crystallin was prepared from bovine lenses by gel chromatography.|
10564717|MDA was freshly prepared and incubated with G6PD with or without alpha-crystallin.|
10564717|The results show that MDA reacted with G6PD non-enzymically causing inactivation at concentrations lower than those used previously on structural proteins.|MDA|orch|23|25|CAUSES|VERB|61|67|inactivation|comd|69|80|
10564717|The modified enzyme became fluorescent. alpha-Crystallin, acting as a molecular chaperone, specifically protected the enzyme against inactivation by MDA.|
10564717|The enzyme was not reactivated by alpha-crystallin, but it was stabilised and protected against further denaturation.|
10564717|Complex formation between alpha-crystallin and the modified enzyme was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation.|
10564717|G6PD was very susceptible to MDA and we have shown for the first time that alpha-crystallin is able to protect the enzyme against this damage.|
10564717|alpha-crystallin protects glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase against inactivation by malondialdehyde.|
